CICD - Independent Study
========================

Outline - as required
---------------------

### A. Project Title

CICD in Distributed Environments

### B. Objectives

The objective is to analyze Continuous integration and deployment practices used in the industry and the free software community with the focus of attempting to create meaningful research and insight into the topic.

On the side, it would be ideal to attempt to explore other topics associated with CICD, such as how cloud computing plays a role in the process or how to manage configurations for continuously deployed applications. Other things, like ensuring near perfect uptime, may also be valuable to the overall research.

### C. Material Requirements

  * Servers 
    * such as Virtual Private Servers (VPS)
	* Home made or provided by external service
  * CI (Continuous Integration) tools (FOSS)
    * Jenkins CI
	* Travis CI
  * CD (Continuous Deployment) tools (FOSS)
	* ansible
	* Custom shell scripts (if no good alternatives?)
	* puppet 
	  * (I believe this is more for config management than deployment)
    * note this isn't an exhaustive list
  * Documentation for said tools
  * Blogs and interviews with developers in this Industry
  *

### D. Outline of Duties to be preformed

  * Compile Research into
    * Paper (with intent to publish)
	* blog posts (intent to track progress)
	* Useful software (intent to solve problems identified)

### E.

To Be Decided
